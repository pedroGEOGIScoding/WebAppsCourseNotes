# Starting a REACT project from scratch

The first thing is to go to <https://vite.dev/guide/> to create a react project with Vite using a template.
The code is:
```java
npm create vite@latest my-vue-app -- --template vue
```
Then, this command should be copied and the word template changed with the name of the project to work on.
