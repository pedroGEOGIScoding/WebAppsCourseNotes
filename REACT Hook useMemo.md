Class: FRONTEND

Notes: Hook useMemo

The hook useMemo is a React Hook that lets you cache the result of a calculation between re-renders. Usually it is used to save cache between renders with processes or intensive calculations to optimize performance in expensive computations. So, useMemo is used for **memorization**, a technique to optimize performance by caching the results of expensive computations.

```jsx
const cachedValue = useMemo(calculateValue, dependencies)
```

This optimization is particularly useful for avoiding unnecessary re-renders in components. Itâ€™s commonly employed for computationally intensive tasks, like complex calculations or data processing, where you want to avoid redundant work. By memorizing values, useMemo helps improve React application efficiency and responsiveness.
